<p>
A <b><em><font size=5> shepherd</em></font></b> boy in a village used to take his herd of sheep across the fields<br>
near the forest. He felt this job was very dull and wanted to have some fun.
</p>
<br>

<p>
One day while <u>grazing</u> the sheep, he shouted, "Wolf! Wolf! The wolf is carrying<br>
away a lamb!" Farmers working in the nearby fields came running for help but<br>
didn't find any wolf.
</p>
<br>

<p>
The boy laughed and replied, "It was just fun. There is no wolf here". <em><b><font size=5>The boy<br>
played a similar trick repeatedly for many days.</em></b></font>
</p>
<br>

<p>
After some days, while the shepherd boy was in the field with the herd of sheep,<br>
suddenly, a wolf came out from the nearby forest and attacked one of the lambs.<br>
The boy was frightened and cried loudly, "Wolf! Wolf! <strike>The wolf is carrying a<br>
lamb away!"</strike>
</p>
<br>

<p>
<font size=4 color=#633D92>The farmers <sub>thought</sub> the boy was playing <sup>mischier</sup> again.</font> So, no one paid<br>
attention to him and didn't come to his help.
