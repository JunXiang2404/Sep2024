<font> Bödvar - The Unconquered Viking, The Great Bear </font>

<p>
Born of a viking mother and bear father, Bödvar grew up feared and mistrusted by his own people.
Bödvar’s first nemesis was the terrible giant bear Grothnar, his own brother. 
By defeating Grothnar in a battle that lasted seven days, Bödvar chose to side with humanity and became the protector of the people of the north. 
He led his Skandian people against the Witch Queen of Helheim, slew the White Dragon Sorcerer, and lived the life of an all-conquering hero.

<font> Hattori - Demon Bride </font>

<p>
Young Hattori was so gifted with the sword that the Emperor offered a prize of one thousand horses to anyone who could defeat her. 
For years, new warriors came to court every day only to be defeated. 
But on the day the Demon Kagima arrived to challenge her, Hattori sensed his malevolent power and fled. 
Enraged, the Demon kidnapped Hattori’s three sisters and carried them away to his island kingdom.

<font> Asuri - The Night Stalker </font>

<p>
The villages along the Arit river on the Punjab border were proud of their guardian. 
Proud and more than a little scared. The Tiger was a gift from Rama, they said, though a gift rarely seen. 
Years might pass with only a giant paw print in the mud of the riverbank to prove that The Tiger still prowled the forests between the villages.

<font> Koji - The Wanderer, Honor’s Blade </font>

<p>
As the second son Koji knew he would never take over his father’s school or inherit the coveted family sword. 
He spent his days determined to make his own technique, one without a silly made up name. One day that changed. 
Fearful of the “School of the Demon Slaying Sword” a corrupt Shogun ordered Koji’s father and all his students slain. 
To save their legacy, Koji was ordered to take ancestral katana and flee, keeping it safe at all costs

<font> Yumiko - The Kitsune </font>

<p>
Any Valkyrie could see that the blind seamstress was a centuries old fox spirit in disguise. Only the half-Valkyrie saw a great Valhallan. 
From time immemorial the Japanese village of Aoku sat at peace on the edge of the great northern forest.<br>
Then the forest changed.
The winters grew bitter, and the cold seemed to flow out of the forest itself. 
From the forest too came great wolves – first in ones and twos and then in great packs.The forest came to be called Kiba, The Fang, and the villagers feared.

<font> Kaya - The Natural </font>

<p>
When Kaya was six she could put an arrow through a falling snowflake. At eight she brought down two bison with one spear throw. 
At ten she was visited by an owl spirit who told her she would decide the fate of her world. 
More interesting to her, the spirit also showed her how to befriend the wooly mammoth.<br>
<br>
Atop her great mammoth, Blue, Kaya became the beloved icon of her tribe, the People of the Lights.
